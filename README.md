# Hi, I'm Manmit 👋

I'm a passionate builder and educator exploring the intersection of distributed networks, game theory, and blockchain technology.

## Motivation 🔭

Today, over 5 billion people around the globe have access to the world wide web 🌎 The average internet user spends an average of 6 hours browsing more than a 120 webpages every single day. As a result, the internet generates a staggering 30 terabytes of data **every second**. 

We live in a world where everything—news, healthcare, commerce—moves at the speed of the internet. A world where emotion-driven humans interact with data-driven AI models. And this shift brings new challenges: misinformation, cybersecurity risks, and questions of data sovereignty.

I believe blockchains offer a way to embed trust directly into the internet’s infrastructure, and am eager to explore the systems and protocols that can turn this vision into reality.

## Current Interests 🏗️  

As someone who is fascinated by emerging technologies, I'm excited to study and contribute to the following research directions - 

- **Digital Identity:** How can blockchains power robust and compliant digital identities for underserved populations around the world? How can these solutions scale?
- **Bridging Web2<>Web3:** Blockchains are siloed databases, limited to their own user-generated information. How can blockchains learn about the world around them securely?
- **Regulation-Friendly Privacy:** How can companies in sectors like healthcare and supply chain leverage blockchains to enhance efficiency while safeguarding their sensitive data? 

🌱 Always learning, always building!
