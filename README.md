# Hi, I'm Manmit 👋

I'm a passionate builder and educator with a focus on distributed networks, game theory and blockchains.

## Motivation 🔭

Have you ever felt the satisfaction of hearing a 'swoosh' as you send an email or the dopamine rush of checking likes on your latest post? If you're anything like the average internet user—spending six hours daily across 120+ webpages—you probably have 🤓

We live in a world where everything—news, healthcare, commerce—moves at the speed of the internet. A world where emotion-driven humans interact with data-driven AI models. But this shift brings new challenges: misinformation, cybersecurity risks, and questions of data sovereignty.

I believe blockchains offer a way to embed trust directly into the internet’s infrastructure, and am eager to explore the protocols that can turn this vision into reality.

## Current Interests 🏗️  

As a keen observer of the web, I'm excited to study and contribute to the following research directions - 

- Digital Identity: How can blockchains power robust and compliant digital identities for underserved populations around the world? How can these solutions scale?
- Bridging Web2<>Web3: Blockchains are siloed databases, limited to their own user-generated information. How can blockchains learn about the world around them securely?
- Accountable Data Privacy: How can users share their personal data with machine learning models without compromising with their privacy? And be sure they're getting the right answer?
